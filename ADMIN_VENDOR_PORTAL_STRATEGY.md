# ADMIN & VENDOR PORTAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
**eGroceryMart Multi-Vendor Grocery Platform**

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**
Building clean, separate Admin and Vendor Portals by reusing existing theme/layout components from the old admin folder, creating new directory structures (`admin-portal/`, `vendor-portal/`).

## 🚀 **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**
- **Frontend Only**: UI/UX implementation with mock data for client demos
- **No Backend Integration**: Pure frontend development
- **No i18n**: Static English content only
- **No GraphQL**: Direct component development
- **Component Reusability**: Leverage existing theme, layouts, and UI components from `/admin` folder
